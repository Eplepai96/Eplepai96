# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Andreas Lindseth :)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Portfolio 2
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React.js

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: I'm fine with any, just happy you want to talk to me :)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once went up to an old lady from behind, leaned my head over her shoulder, and said "noooooodle-salad". Wish I had realised sooner my girlfriend (with the same color hair and jacket) had stopped by the grapes. 

## About me
I live in Sandefjord, Norway, with my partner of nine years. I spend a decent amount of time alone, which I enjoy, but also love being with friends or meeting new people. Navigating an identity that differs a lot from the people I see around me was a challenge for me for a long time, but in recent years I have grown to accept myself more and find a place I'm confident and happy being in. I am a person who always smiles and meet people in a respectful manner. I am often pretty quiet, but that does not mean I don't enjoy a good conversation. I love solving problems together. I believe everyone has something to contribute and that we all bring valuable viewpoints to a conversation or a problem that needs to be solved. When people want to correct me or tell me to do something differently, I am good at listening, as long as the criticism is given in a respectful manner. I try my hardest to learn from mistakes and actually grow from them. I'm not quick to criticise other people, and from prior work experience I should work on giving it a little sooner rather than later. Other than this I am not a person who takes a lot of space, and I think I am pretty easy to be around. I'll express my boundaries and clearly communicate it when they are being overstepped, but I will also try my best to understand where people are coming from. 

I'm coming towards an end in my studies, and currently looking for entry level front-end jobs or an oppurtunity to work as an intern. I am planning to study psychology part time in a couple of years, after I have gained some more front-end experience. I want to also work part time as a developer while studying. I am hoping to apply some of what i learn from these studies to design. I eventually want to have two jobs; one working with psychology and one working with coding. I think this will make me happy and fullfilled ðŸ˜„

## Hobbies
I love nature, and spend a lot of time outside. I like to fish and look for mushrooms, as well as hiking and outdoors activities. I also love gaming, and spend time in the evening playing Fortnite or Rocket League with friends and my partner. I have interest in fashion with focus on being environmentally friendly. Psychology is very interesting to me, and spend a decent amount of my free time reading studies on topics that concern or interest me.
