# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Andreas Lindseth :)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Portfolio
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I'll update this later
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: I'm fine with any, just happy you want to talk to me :)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once went up to an old lady from behind, leaned my head over her shoulder, and said "noooooodle-salad". Wish I had realised sooner my girlfriend (with the same color hair and jacket) had stopped by the grapes. 

## About me
I live in Sandefjord, Norway. I study front-end development at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media, while still keeping my job at a store. I study to gain technological knowledge, as technology has always been a little tricky to me, and I'd like to understand more about it. I also like to be creative, although my creative sides are a little rusty at the time being. I like science, and do well in biology and chemistry, but tech and math have sort of been my nemesis. 

I like to improve on things I find challenging, and even though the learning curve is pretty steep that way, I love to see the progress. I sometimes ask myself why I don't just keep studying and doing the things I'm already good at, but then I remember where I'd be if I always took the easy way out.
